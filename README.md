ZeroMQ is a distributed messaging system.

You can get the software from http://zeromq.org/

This project uses the publish/subscribe pattern of ZeroMQ.

Publish/Subscribe is another classic pattern where senders of messages, called publishers, do not program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers, called subscribers. Messages are published without the knowledge of what or if any subscriber of that knowledge exists.

The interface created using the Qt framework.
